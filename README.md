## M.Tech Course Project : Measurement &amp; Data Analysis (AE 669)

– Implemented the Signal Processing Toolbox to calculate and plot the normalized auto-correlation function with a time separation of 10−3 seconds from hot-wire anemometer data
– Evaluated velocity data of order 105 from 400 PIV realizations sampled at 365 Hz, including the estimation and plotting of mean, RMS, and correlation contours of velocity components
